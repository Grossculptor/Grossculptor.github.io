## Generative Commit Sculpture

This repository includes an experimental sculpture system that transforms commit history into
multi-dimensional 3D artworks revealing emergent patterns in development activity.

### Basic Sculpture
View the [basic temporal sculpture](./commit_sculpture.html) showing commit frequency over time.

### Enhanced Multi-Dimensional Sculptures
**[View Enhanced Sculptures](./commit_sculpture_enhanced.html)** — Four aesthetic modes revealing:
- **Organic**: Branch-like growth patterns showing human vs automation collaboration
- **Crystalline**: Geometric formations exposing code structure and impact magnitude
- **Rhythmic**: 24-hour wave patterns revealing temporal development rhythms
- **Chaotic**: Emergent complexity from change magnitude and commit properties

Each mode visualizes 7+ data dimensions: author type, temporal patterns, file changes,
impact magnitude, commit bursts, collaboration networks, and hour-of-day rhythms.

### Generate Your Own

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate enhanced sculptures:
```bash
# Organic mode (branch structures)
python scripts/generate_enhanced_sculpture.py --repo-path . --days 200 --mode organic --output models/sculpture.glb

# Or try: crystalline, rhythmic, chaotic
```

Generate basic sculpture:
```bash
python scripts/generate_commit_sculpture.py --owner USER --repo REPO --days 30
```

Experiment with random commit histories:
```bash
python scripts/commit_randomizer.py --repo-path . --count 10
```
